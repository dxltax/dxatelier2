<h2>The Last Time You Replied<br><small style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #aaa;">— from "What Happens When I Stop?"</small></h2>

<p>The short reply you gave that day<br>
was the last I ever received.</p>

<p>Even after all the long messages I sent,<br>
the pleading, the disappointment I poured out—<br>
none of it moved you.<br>
Not a single word made its way into your heart.</p>

<p>I counted every second,<br>
hoping that just once,<br>
you would ask me to stay.<br>
But you didn’t.</p>

<p>Only silence,<br>
dressed up as hope,<br>
wore the mask of a response.</p>

<p>And that’s when I knew.<br>
That day… was the last.</p>
